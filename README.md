# Assignment 2 – Vehicle Management System

## Project Overview
This project is a Java-based Vehicle Management System created to demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as inheritance, abstraction, composition, aggregation, and method overriding.

The system models different types of vehicles and their associated drivers using a clean and structured class hierarchy.

## OOP Concepts Used
- Inheritance: Car, Motorcycle, and Truck inherit from the abstract Vehicle class
- Abstraction: Vehicle is an abstract class with abstract and concrete methods
- Method Overriding: Each subclass provides its own implementation of engine methods
- Composition and Aggregation: Each Vehicle has a Driver, and one Driver can be associated with multiple Vehicles

## Class Hierarchy
- Vehicle (abstract superclass)
- Car
- Motorcycle
- Truck
- Driver

## How to Compile and Run



## Program Features
- Abstract superclass with shared fields and methods
- Multiple subclasses with overridden behavior
- Driver class demonstrating association
- Array of Vehicle objects processed using polymorphism

## Reflection
Inheritance simplified the design by allowing common logic to be reused across different vehicle types.  
Method overriding enabled each vehicle to define its own engine behavior.  
Working with protected access modifiers required careful planning to maintain encapsulation.
